Part1 plan

1. demonstrate how p and q are generated
2. how e is generated 0<e<r   e no common factor with r
3. how private key d and public (e,n) are generated

4. show a special case where program does not work securely
program should as to input some parameters that would lead to problem.


e,n -> public key
d,n -> private key








-----------------------------------------

instruction for running the project

styling

use wolfram alpha api for guessing RSA ? maybe theres some ready api for it


--- to do now ---

usePrimes should check if input number is a prime and inform

enetering e should check if e is smaller then o(n)

figure out when genereting d will get stuck, and prevent it
