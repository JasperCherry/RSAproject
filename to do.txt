Part1 plan

1. demonstrate how p and q are generated
2. how e is generated 0<e<r   e no common factor with r
3. how private key d and public (e,n) are generated

4. show a special case where program does not work securely
program should as to input some parameters that would lead to problem.


e,n -> public key
d,n -> private key
